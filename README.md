# Character Sheet Resume Page for Dan Robertson

This is an alternate-style about me/resume page for Dan Robertson. As a student of Code Kentucky, this is my first step into the world of front-end web development. I have modeled this page after a Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition character sheet, but with some heavy modifications visually to make it more suitable for the real world. Features include: a responsive menu built using Javascript, a transition animation on an element in-use, and a simple hide/show div with CSS.
